Dave played a key role as an assistant coach helping to win several national titles in the \u201880\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s. He also served as the head coach of the UBC team in 1992, leading that team to a national championship that season, a run of 4 titles in a row! Partridge was the head coach that season as Dick Mosher took a year long sabattical away from coaching and professor duties.\n\nAfter several years away from UBC and working in the high school education system in Richmond, BC, Dave returned to help with the program again in 2015. Partridge helped Coach Mike Mosher in varying capacities right through this past 2024 national championship season. This past year Partridge was tasked largely with watching games on video and helping to provide the staff with scouting reports on opponents. \n\nDavid Partridge cared deeply about the UBC soccer program, the staff and student athletes involved. His presence and support of the program will be missed dearly. Rest in peace Dave. Side Before Self.",
